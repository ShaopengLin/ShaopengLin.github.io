I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science (DCS)]([https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto (UofT)](https://www.utoronto.ca/), working with [Prof. Gururaj Saileshwar](https://gururaj-s.github.io/) in the Securing Systems via Trustworthy Hardware (SITH) Lab.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray; margin-left: 0px; width: 67%;">
I am seeking internship opportunities in Systems & ML Security, HPC, or Compilers for Summer 2026. Please feel free to reach out if you‚Äôre interested.

My research interest lies in Hardware/Memory/ML Security, Compiler Optimizations, and ML-Systems and Accelerators. My current research focuses on Rowhammer attacks and defenses, as well as protecting ML systems from potential attack vectors. My prior research involved enabling Rowhammer attacks on NVIDIA GPUs, which can be leveraged to degrade deep learning models. Additionally, I have worked on improving existing Per-Row Activation Counting (PRAC) Rowhammer Defense mechanisms. Currently, I‚Äôm exploring a range of compiler and hardware techniques to attack or protect LLM training/inference pipelines and parallel computing systems.

As a software engineer, I am intrigued by low-level and hardware-related programming and have 2-years of experience experienced in C/C++ and Python programming. I am experienced in Compiler Engineering and Qt GUI development. My last internship is at [Huawei Canada](https://www.huawei.com/ca/) and I also participates in Open Source Development via [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/). I do Android, Graphics Computing, and Game development on the side. 

Before I started my PhD at University of Toronto, I recieved my B.S. in Computer Science at University of Toronto's satellite campus in Scarborough, on 2024.

During my down time, I am a competent Badminton üè∏ Player :). I actively play the [Monster Hunter Series üêâ‚öîÔ∏è](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter), [Hollow Knight (Silk Song Hype) üíÄ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight), [Balatro üÉè](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balatro), and [Arknights üõ•Ô∏è](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights). I am also happily married :).

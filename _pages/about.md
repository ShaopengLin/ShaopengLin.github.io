I am a Ph.D. student in the [Department of Computer Science (DCS)](https://web.cs.toronto.edu/) at the [University of Toronto (UofT)](https://www.utoronto.ca/), working with [Prof. Gururaj Saileshwar](https://gururaj-s.github.io/) in the Securing Systems via Trustworthy Hardware (SITH) Lab.

<hr style="border:2px solid gray; margin-left: 0px; width: 67%;">
I am seeking internship opportunities in Systems & ML Security, HPC, or Compilers for Summer 2026. Please feel free to reach out if you’re interested.

My research interests span **hardware, memory, and machine learning (ML) security, compiler optimizations, and ML systems and accelerators**. Currently, I focus on Rowhammer attacks and defenses, as well as securing ML systems against emerging threat vectors. My earlier work demonstrated the feasibility of **Rowhammer attacks on NVIDIA GPUs**, which can be exploited to degrade deep learning models. I have also contributed to enhancing Per-Row Activation Counting (PRAC), a state-of-the-art Rowhammer defense. More recently, I’ve been exploring compiler and hardware techniques to attack or protect large language model (LLM) training and inference pipelines, as well as parallel computing systems.

As a software engineer, I have a strong interest in low-level and hardware-centric programming, with over two years of experience in **C/C++** and **Python**. I also have experience in **compiler** engineering and **Qt**-based GUI development. I previously interned at Huawei Canada and participated in Google Summer of Code (**GSOC**) through open-source contributions. In my spare time, I enjoy working on Android apps, graphics computing, and game development.

Before starting my Ph.D. at the University of Toronto, I earned a B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Toronto Scarborough in 2024. I have also served as a Teaching Assistant at UTSC for over three years.

During my down time, I am a competent Badminton 🏸 Player :). I actively play the [Monster Hunter Series 🐉⚔️](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monster_Hunter), [Hollow Knight (Silk Song Hype) 💀](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollow_Knight), [Balatro 🃏](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balatro), and [Arknights 🛥️](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arknights). I am also happily married ❤️💍❤️ with Linghe (Flora) Zhao.
